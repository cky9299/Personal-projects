Personal-projects
=================
This repos contains personal projects that I work on during my free time.

# Projects:
1.	Implemented smart contracts that function as a lottery (lottery.sol) and a fundraiser (FundMe.sol) respectively.
2.	Developed games (Connect 4 and tic-tac-toe) equipped with audio and graphics using HTML, CSS and JS.
3.	Written Python Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs that recognize handwritten digits (digits recognizer.py) and plot a best fit line (best fit.py) based on (randomly) given coordinates respectively. Due to the large dataset used, please allow digits recognizer.py to run for up to 20 mins.
4.	Programmed a crypto profitability calculator (detCryptoProfitability.py) based on entry price, exit price, and dollars spent.
5.	Developed a program that queries and logs the price details of 1m candles of all cryptos on an exchange (get1mcandles.py).
